Our progress through 30.10.2023 - 09.11.2023

- review_text column is preprocessed and ready to be fed into models
- 'goodreads_reviews_spoiler.json' and 'goodreads_reviews_spoiler_raw.json' are cleaned and merged together. The '.ipynb' file responsible for this has been uploaded.
- A tiny version of the updated dataset has been uploaded to GitHub.

Our progress through 10.11.2023 - 20.11.2023
-merged two of our data preprocessing files into one "preprocessing.ipynb" file
-added some very basic data analysis (may do more down the line)

Our progress through 20.11.2023 - 4.12.2023
-completed preliminary LSTM model that uses raw text files (glove embedding ->  around 0.5 f1 score)
-completed deep learning model that uses rest of the data (num of comments, ratings, book name etc.)
-completed preliminary random forest algorithm that is fed with outputs of both DL models (around 0.55 f1score)

Our progress through 4.12.2023 - 17.12.2023
-updated LSTM model (now a 0.65~0.7 f1 score) run on colab's gpu
